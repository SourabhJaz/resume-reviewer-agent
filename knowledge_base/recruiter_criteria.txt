Recruiters at top tech firms prioritize the following:
- Clarity and conciseness in job descriptions.
- Evidence of impact through quantifiable metrics (e.g., “reduced latency by 40%”).
- Clear ownership: use of “I” vs “we” when discussing individual contributions.
- Technical depth: mention of architecture, tech stacks, tools, and design choices.
- Progression: roles should show increasing scope or impact over time.
- Leadership signals: mentoring, technical decision-making, cross-functional collaboration.
- Communication and presentation: avoid dense blocks of text; use bullet points effectively.
