Best practices for technical resumes:
- Keep it to 1 page for <10 years experience; 2 pages max otherwise.
- Use active verbs: Designed, Led, Optimized, Reduced, Implemented.
- Every bullet should reflect impact or outcome, not just tasks.
- Avoid generic claims like “team player” or “problem solver” without examples.
- Consistency matters: use the same formatting, font, and tense throughout.
- Use reverse chronological format for experience.
- Include GitHub, portfolio, or LinkedIn only if well-maintained.
